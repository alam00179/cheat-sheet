### Golang cheat sheet
The Go programming language is an open source project to make programmers more productive.

Go is expressive, concise, clean, and efficient. Its concurrency mechanisms make it easy to write programs that get the most out of multicore and networked machines, while its novel type system enables flexible and modular program construction. Go compiles quickly to machine code yet has the convenience of garbage collection and the power of run-time reflection. It's a fast, statically typed, compiled language that feels like a dynamically typed, interpreted language.

In addition to the resources available [at golang.org](http://golang.org/doc/#learning) there are a range of community-driven initiatives:

- **Orgs:**
  - [GoBridge](https://golangbridge.org/): Building Bridges That Educate & 
Empower Underrepresented Communities
  - [Women Who Go](http://www.womenwhogo.org/): We are women of the Go community.

- **Starter Books:**
  - [The Little Go Book](http://openmymind.net/The-Little-Go-Book/): The Little Go Book is a free introduction to Google's Go programming language. It's aimed at developers who might not be quite comfortable with the idea of pointers and static typing. It's longer than the other Little books, but hopefully still captures that little feeling.
  - [An Introduction to Programming in Go](http://openmymind.net/The-Little-Go-Book/): This book is a short, concise introduction to computer programming using the language Go. Designed by Google, Go is a general purpose programming language with modern features, clean syntax and a robust well-documented common library, making it an ideal language to learn as your first programming language.

  - [The Go Programming Language](http://www.gopl.io/): The Go Programming Language* is the authoritative resource for any programmer who wants to learn Go. Alan A. A. Donovan and Brian W. Kernighan show you how to write clear and idiomatic Go to solve real-world problems. The book does not assume prior knowledge of Go nor experience with any specific language, so you'll find it accessible whether you're most comfortable with JavaScript, Ruby, Python, Java, or C++. The book features hundreds of interesting and practical examples of idiomatic Go code that cover the whole language, its most important libraries, and a wide range of applications. Source code is freely available for download from the book's companion web site and may be conveniently fetched, built, and installed using the `go get` command.
  - [Go in Action](https://www.manning.com/books/go-in-action): Go in Action introduces the Go language, guiding you from inquisitive developer to Go guru. The book begins by introducing the unique features and concepts of Go.

Then, you'll get hands-on experience writing real-world applications including web sites and network servers, as well as techniques to manipulate and convert data at speeds that will make your friends jealous. In the final chapters, you'll go in-depth with the language and see the tricks and secrets that the Go masters are using to make their applications perform. For example, you'll learn to use Go's powerful reflection libraries and work with real-world examples of integration with C code.
